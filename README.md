ClockWidget
===========

First iOS8 Clockwidget 

This Widget uses the new iOS 8 Notification Center extensions to create two clocks with different times inside the notification center. 

### How it Works 
* Download the Xcode Project 
* Build and run it on your iPhone 
* You will have an App with an white window 
* Open Notification Center 
* Add your widget at the bottom 

At the Moment I only support San Francisco and Frankfurt time zones. (Because I'm attending WWDC at the Moment)

Have fun and try it ;)
